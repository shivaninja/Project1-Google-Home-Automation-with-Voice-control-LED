Light that can be controlled using Voice and Google Assistant


# Project1 — Google Home Automation with Voice-Controlled LED 🔊💡

Control your home lighting using Google Assistant, Sinric Pro, and an ESP32.
This project demonstrates how to turn a light bulb ON/OFF via voice commands, using a relay connected to the ESP32 as the switching interface.

# 🚀 Overview

This project integrates:

Sinric Pro IoT platform

Google Home voice assistant

ESP32 microcontroller

Once configured, you can say:

“Hey Google, turn ON the light.”

The ESP32 receives the command through Sinric Pro and switches the connected relay, which controls an AC-powered light bulb.

# 📡 Architecture

Google Home → Sinric Pro Cloud → ESP32 → Relay Module → Light Bulb

The ESP32 runs a lightweight loop where it listens for events (ON/OFF) from Sinric and toggles GPIO5 accordingly.

# 🧰 Hardware Used
Component	Purpose
ESP32	Main microcontroller
Relay module	Switches AC power to the light
Light bulb	Controlled load
Jumper wires	Electrical connections
# 🔌 ESP32 Pinout
Pin	Description
GPIO 5	Relay control pin
VCC	Relay power (typically 5V or 3.3V depending on your module)
GND	Ground

⚠️ Note: Most relay modules are Active LOW (LOW = ON, HIGH = OFF).
